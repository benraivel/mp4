#we make an sql query and store the result as queried_data
#queried_data is a data frame with each row as a specific route. This means that for every pairing of start and end location, there is a row in this data frame. For analyzation purposes, we took the most popular 100 routes. 
#The data frame has 5 columns. start_lat and start_lon are the latitude and longitude of the starting location, with end_lat and end_lon as the latitude and longitude of the ending location. Our final column, travels, is the number of times people took that route.
#We use nested queries to improve query times. Initially, we did our joinings to get location data while calculating travels and then took the top 100 travels. This took forever. A much more efficient method was to calculate the top 100 travels, and then only join the location data onto that much smaller table with 100 rows.
#The query finds the most popular 100 routes, and then joins that data onto station_months twice in order to get location information for the starting and ending location. From here, we select the 5 rows mentioned earlier: the latitudes and longitudes for starting and ending location and the amount of times each route was travelled.
queried_data <- dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT s1.avg_lat as start_lat, 
s1.avg_lon as start_lon, s2.avg_lat as end_lat, s2.avg_lon as end_lon, travelcount as travels
